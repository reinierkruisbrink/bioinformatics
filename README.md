> Learning bioinformatics usually requires solving computational problems of varying difficulty that are extracted from **real challenges of molecular biology**.

> To make learning bioinformatics fun and easy, we have founded Rosalind, a **platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving**.

> Rosalind offers an array of intellectually stimulating problems that grow in biological and computational complexity; **each problem is checked automatically**, so that the only resource required to learn bioinformatics is an internet connection.
